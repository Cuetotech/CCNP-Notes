Module 2: Packet Switching

Layer 2 Swtich Operations:
- Forwards frames based on destination MAC address
- Builds CAM based on source MAC
- CAM includes VLAN, ports, MACs
- Uses ACLs from TCAM to determine whether to forward
- Uses QoS to determine how to forwards

Layer 2 Frame Forwarding:
- The swtich basically copies the frame from the memory on the ingress port to the memory on the egress (queueing)
- The CAM table has aging time. Basically MAC with no activity (default 300 seconds) get removed. 
*** Issue a aging time of 0 to disable the aging timer. This make entries static.

Layer 3 Swtich Operations: 
- Operates at Layer 2 and 3
- Forwards frames based on destination MAC and IP
- Uses CAM to forward Layer 2 traffic and FIB for Layer 3
* The FIB merges information from the ARP table and the RIB
* QoS and ACLs are stored in the TCAM

Multilayer Switch Forwarding:
- Every time a packet changes hands the checksum is calculated to ensure integrity of the packet.
- If the packet is decapsulated and other things are added to it this is called frame rewriting
- Every time the packet hops the TTL is decreased by one 

Packet Switching Techniques:
- Process Switching: Software switching, is the slowest, and only used when handling encrypted packets. For every packet the router creates a new Layer 2 header before forwarding
- Fast Switching: Route caching, uses the CPU to create an entry in the cache. Once a "flow" is established it utilizes hardware for swtiching. 
- Cisco Express Forwarding (CEF): Topology-based switching, uses the FIB and Adjancency tables.
-- FIB is building from the ARP and the RIB and it stores routes
-- Adjacency tables are built from the ARP table and it stores next-hop interfaces
** CEF can do loadbalancing. The "per destination" (default) method all packets going to the same place go over a single flow. The "per packet" are distributed across of available paths. Cisco DOES NOT recommend per packet when there is VoIP involved)
** CEF can load balance using any of the four algorithms: Original (uses a hash of the source and dest IP to identify flow), universal (same as original but adds a unique identifier), tunnel, include-ports (Layer 4 Port Numbers are considered). 
** With CEF there is no flooding. If there is not an entry in the FIB the packet gets dropped

Quality of Service: 
- QoS is useful to categorize and prioritize traffic. 
- Default is FIFO, where the RX ring will drop incoming packets if the queue is full. 
* Traffic Classification and Marking:
- Cisco offers class maps, which matches ACP statements to classify up to Layer 4
-- Classification at Layer 2: 
--- Class of Service (802.1p) is a 3 bit priority code point (PCP) which maps the priority to a frame.
--- Traffic ID (802.11e)
-- Classification at Layer 3:
--- ToS exists in the IP header for QoS. It stores an IP Precedence value (3 bit that map to a L2 CoS) or a DSCP which is 6 bits in lenght.
---- DSCP has four general class: Best effort, class selector, assured forwarding, and expedited forwarding.
*** Some Cisco platforms can do NBAR to inspect up to Layer 7
*** Place the QoS policy as close to the network edge and extend the trust boundary to the IP Phone
**** When marked traffic is received from an untrusted source the network device will remark it.
*** CoS markings are Voice (5), Video (4), Transactional (2) and Background (0)
* Congestion Management: 
- Queueing
-- FIFO (default) packets leave in the order they come
-- Priority Queueing (PQ) creates four queues, it can create network starvation
-- Custom Queueing (CQ) create 16 queues serviced in round-robin fashion, nothing is a priority
-- WFQ dynamically creates 256 queues, smaller traffic has higher priority
-- CBWFQ expands on WFQ by allowing custom classes to be made
-- LLQ adds strict priorty for voice and video traffic
- Scheduling
-- Strict, Round Robin, Weighted Fair
- Congestion Avoidance
-- Tail drop is the dropping of frames when the queue is full. The problem with tail drop is that it can create TCP synchronization. 
-- Random Early Detection (RED) can avoid TCP synchronization. Randomly dropping packets. Cisco's version is Weighted RED which discards packets randomly but taking into consideration IPP. 
- Policing and Shaping
-- Policing drops excessive traffic with no jitter or delay. (Typically implemented on ingress)
-- Shapping buffers the excessive traffic introducing jitter and delay (Typically on Egress for SLA)
