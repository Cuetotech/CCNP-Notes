Module 3 : Virtualization
Why?: Scalability and efficient use of hardware
Device virtualization via Hypervisors Type 1 or 2
-- Type 1: Baremetal, directly on hardware (VMWare ESXi, Hyper-V, Proxmox, XenServer)
-- Type 2: Runs on top of OS, software that manages hardware (VMWare Player, VirtualBox, QEMU)
Network Virtualization using vSwitches
-- vSwitch: Emulates a Layer 2 switch. Some vSwitches are Nexus 1000VE, Open vSwitch, Cisco Application Virtual Switch (AVS) VMWare vSphere Switch.
** You cannot interconnect two vSwitches. Two vSwitches CANNOT connect to one pNIC at the same time
Data Path Virtualization:
-- VLANs: Enables a physical switch to operate as multiple vSwitches by logically segmenting it
-- VRFs: Enables a router to operate as multiple routers. Only one interface per VRF is allowed. Usually seen with MPLS.
-- VRF Lite: Implementation without MPLS. VRFs are placed in the Provider Edge. 
**** Does not support IS-IS or IGRP
-- VPNs: Creates an overlay network on an existing network. Can replace private WAN technologies such as Frame Relay, PTP leased lines. 
--- IPSec: Provides encryption, data integrity, and authentication. Supports Transport and Tunnel.
---- Tunnel mode is NAT Friendly, encrypts entire packet and then puts in an uncrypted packet. 
---- Transport mode is NOT NAT Friendly, encrypts only the payload
---- Authentication Header (AH) verifies the sender but does not encrypt. 
---- Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) encrypts the data, verifies the sending, and ensures integrity.
** Both can be configured together
---- Encryption in IPSec
----- DES (56 bit), 3DES (Splits data into 3 64 bit chunks and then encrypts each chuck with a diff 56 bit key), AES (128, 192, 256)
----- Must choose a DH public key exchange method. DH1, DH2, DH5.
---- Data integrity using MD5 (128 bit hash), SHA 1 (160 bit hash) which are HMACs.
---- Authentication methods are PSK or Digital Signature (hash encrypted with RSA)
--- GRE Tunnel: (IP protocol 47) Cisco proprietary protocol that creates a virtual tunnel capable of passing any traffic without encryption. 
**** Can be combined with IPSec GRE over IPSec
**** Can be used for multicast traffic (useful for OSPF/EIGRP advertisement)
--- DMVPN Tunnel: 
---- Cisco proprietary VPN that uses multipoint GRE.  Its dynamic because only makes connections when needed and removes them when disconnected. 
---- It utilizes IPSec and the Next Hop Resolution Protocol (NHRP)
---- Supports two topologies: Hub and Spoke or Spoke to Spoke
----- Hub and Spoke: Hub router uses 1 tunnel interface to connect to multiple spoke routers. The spokes use HNRP to make a connection back to the hub.
----- Spoke to Spoke: Spokes learn the Public IP of other spokes using NHRP and then establish IPSec tunnels with the other spokes (which means no multicast and only IP traffic)
